This project was bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js).

The home repository of [jaysee.tech](https://jaysee.tech).

This project was made possible by Create-React-App (Takes care of the headache of having to configure a ton of files)

Currently I do not like it's state because I feel like I am not using react in its full potential and I am still limited with my knowledge because I am stil learning react.

I am still trying to figure out a good design system to follow(I am currently trying to create on myself for this website). And good ways to scale this website and handle complexity as this website grows(I am really bad at it, check out my nav.tsx, it looks confusing at first). I want my code to be readable for first time comers so that It is much easier to add features.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
